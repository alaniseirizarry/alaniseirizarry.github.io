       <h1> About me!</h1>
Here is a little about me. I am a student at 
<a href="http://www.uri.edu"> University of Rhode Island</a>. I am majoring in Journalism, but thought that gaining knowledge by minoring in Computer Science would be very beneficial.
I am aiming towards heading in a path in technical writing.<br>
I am from Puerto Rico and came all the way over to Rhode Island for college. At home I enjoy going to the beach and spending quality time with my family and friends. 
Here at college I enjoy dedicating myself to my studies, working, and hanging out with my friends.
